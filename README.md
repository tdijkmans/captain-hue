# ‚öì Captain Morse | A simple but life saving app ‚öì

### What this app is about

Captain Hue is a little word-guessing game using Morse Code. The app outlines the imaginary situation where Captain Hue is on his boat Q42 and sinking due to a storm. Signaling 'SOS' in Morse Code does not work ( ... \_\_\_ ...) - so the urgent riddle is: _Which message does work to the lives of Captain Hue and his desparate crew?_

\*\*\* note: The only browser that currently supports this app is Google Chrome, this is due voice recognition software.

### Goals of this project

As part of Codaisseur's Web Development Bootcamp an assignment was given: build an app, with one fellow student, in one week, given the theme 'Language and letters'.
This Captain is an adaption of Captain Morse (see that repo), to signal Q42 and its illuminous Hue-crew üí°.

### Tech used in the project

- ReactJS for UI building (frontend only, no backend)
- the built-in web brower speech recognition engine for converting speech to transcript
- JS functions to convert transcripts to morse code
- the built-in tone generator to output Morse Code in sound
- timed displaying of 4 PNG images to render synchronous Morse Code 'flashing'
